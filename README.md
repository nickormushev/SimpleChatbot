# SimpleChatbot

The main.py works in the terminal and the main_discord.py works with the discord.
This chatbot is trained on a small data set that is placed in the data.json file. To add more responses you have to add a new class with a few example patterns to match for that class. If the class matches a random response is chosen from the responses field.
